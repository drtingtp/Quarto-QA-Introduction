  abstract = {To improve the quality of health care globally, it is imperative first to be able to characterize and quantify the burden of low-quality care. To gain a comprehensive understanding of this burden in low-resource settings, the committee commissioned a team of analysts at the Harvard Initiative on Global Health Quality to analyze available data on the quality of care across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with emphasis on the six dimensions of quality care introduced in Chapter 1: safety, effectiveness, person-centeredness, timeliness, efficiency, and equity. While the results of this review reveal that the quality of care globally is poor, what is also clear is the paucity of data on quality for many places. Proper metrics for tracking quality---not just inputs, but also processes and outcomes---are necessary to assure and improve levels of quality. Several global efforts are under way to develop such metrics, but their effectiveness will depend on partnering with LMICs to adapt them to various settings.},

  abstract = {Despite a sustained and massive increase in spending with the NHS, the evidence that care has improved, other than in areas of performance that have been intensively managed or rewarded by additional cash bonuses, is poor to non-existent. This failure to achieve across-the-board improvement is attributable to the fact that the outcomes of healthcare are `system properties' and are unlikely to improve as a result of more work being put through the same system, and instead will only improve if healthcare providers at all levels are actively encouraged to redesign the system to improve on current performance. The most important way to achieve the `will' to make such changes is to use data, preferably collected with minimal additional work, to generate clinically convincing case-mix-adjusted analyses of quality of care. Examples are given from the centre-specific analyses published by the UK Renal Registry, a fully electronic registry that analyses data extracted direct from renal information technology systems used in each primary care trust that provides renal replacement therapy, and from other national and regional quality improvement programmes. The NHS has unrivalled opportunities to learn from high performance and to use this learning to narrow the gap between best and worst.},
