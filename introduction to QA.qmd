::: notes
How do you define quality for a handbag?
:::

## World Health Organization (WHO)

::: fragment
> ... the extent to which health care services provided to individuals and patient populations improve desired health outcomes.
:::

::: fragment
> In order to achieve this, health care must be safe, effective, timely, efficient, equitable and people-centred.
:::

::: notes
Generally quality measurements in health care should in a way, improve health outcomes.
:::

## World Health Organization (WHO)

Quality health services should be:

::: {.incremental}

*   **Effective** - providing evidence-based healthcare services to those who need them;
*   **Safe** - avoiding harm to people for whom the care is intended; and
*   **People-centred** - providing care that responds to individual preferences, needs and values.

:::

## World Health Organization (WHO)

To realize the benefits of quality health care, health services must be:

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 90%;"}

*   **Timely** – reducing waiting times and sometimes harmful delays;
*   **Equitable** – providing care that does not vary in quality on account of gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socio-economic status;
*   **Integrated** – providing care that makes available the full range of health services throughout the life course;
*   **Efficient** – maximizing the benefit of available resources and avoiding waste.

:::

## Dimensions of Quality

*   Safe
*   Timely
*   Effective
*   Equitable
*   Efficient
*   People-centred

## Simon Sinek - Start With Why - Quotes

::: {.fragment}
> We assume, even, we know why we do what we do
:::

::: {.fragment}
> How do you explain when things don't go as we assume?
:::

::: {.fragment}
> How do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions?
:::

::: {.fragment}
> ... to seek out a solution, to be passionate about something again.

## Simon Sinek - The Golden Circle

![](images/golden-circle.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
Every person in the organisation knows WHAT they do.

Some, knows HOW to do it properly. The processes. The SOP.

Very few, know WHY they do what they do.

Another example is RCT - you know how to do it, do you know why you are doing certain procedures in RCT?
:::

## Simon Sinek
Why?

::: {.incremental}
*   Not to earn a living, that is a result.
*   What is your purpose? Cause? Belief? For work.
*   Why do the organisation exist?
*   Why do the MOH exist?
:::

::: {.notes}
Why do the MOH exists?

Vision:
A nation working together for better health.
Negara menggembleng tenaga ke arah kesihatan yang lebih baik.

Objective:
1. Untuk membantu seseorang individu untuk mencapai dan mengekalkan satu taraf kesihatan bagi membolehkannya menjalankan kehidupan ekonomi dan sosial yang produktif.
2. Ini boleh dicapai dengan menyediakan perkhidmatan bercorak penggalakan, pencegahan, rawatan dan pemulihan yang cekap, sesuai dan berkesan dengan memberi penekanan kepada golongan-golongan yang kurang bernasib baik.

*   Responsiveness to perceived care needs
*   Level of communication, concern and courtesy
*   Degree of symptom relief
*   Level of functional improvement

# QA Concepts

## Quality Assurance (QA)

::: fragment
Definition:

> Identifying problems in the delivery of care and designing and implementing corrective steps to overcome those problems.
:::

::: fragment
Within the context of QA, improvement efforts are focused on raising the level of quality to meet a predefined standard. 
:::

## Quality Assurance (QA) summary

1.  **ASSESS** quality problem (using data)
1.  **CORRECTION** of observed defects (remedial measures)

## ABNA

ABNA (Achievable Benefit Not Achieved):

> The difference between Optimum level and Actual level of achievement.

![](images/abna-1.png)

## ABNA

![](images/abna-2 v2.png)

## ABNA

![](images/abna-3.png)

## Quality Improvement (QI)

::: fragment
Definition:

> Actions that are taken systematically and proactively to continuously improve the processes involved in the delivery of care, based on data.
:::

::: fragment
QI strives to achieve the highest possible rather than reaching a predefined level of quality.
:::

::: fragment
Processes, rather than individuals are at the centre of QI so the activities are intrinsically focused on preventing errors rather than placing blame.
:::

## Quality Improvement (QI) summary

1.  Goal is to attain **HIGHEST POSSIBLE** level of quality
1.  Focuses on both **PROCESSES** and outcome

## Quality Improvement principles

::: incremental
1.  Understanding work in terms of processes and systems
1.  Developing solutions by teams of providers and patients
1.  Focusing on patient needs
1.  Testing and measuring effects of change
1.  Peer learning

## The MOH QA Problem Solving Approach

![QA/QI cycle from @abdullahQAQIWorkbook2020](images/MOH_QA_cycle.png)

::: notes
As you can see, studying the problem is almost half of the cycle.
:::

# Reality check

## Has increased spending resulted in improved quality?

-   Without change of system it will not.
-   Quality will only improve if healthcare providers at all levels are actively encouraged to redesign the system.
-   Data is important to generate clinically convincing analyses of quality of care.
